    "# Exercise 1: **Side-Looking (Real Aperture) Radar**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Explain the geometry associated with a Side-Looking Radar (SLR) and visualize the change of the pixel-size across the swath.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A side-looking Radar observes in the direction perpendicular to the satellite track/direction of propagation. Its antenna is designed in such a way, that it scans a trapezoid-shaped area, whereas the trapezoid is rather narrow in the direction os satellite propagation (though widening the further away from the satelltie a target on the ground is). To achieve this, the antenna needs do be longer in the direction of satellite propagation than perpendicular to it. Thus, the beamwidth of such satellties solely depends on the antenna geometry itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually side-looking real aperture satellites utilize pulses for range resolution. The pixel dimension in the direction of satellite porpagation is a function of the distance $R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_a\\left(R\\right) = 2R\\tan\\left(\\dfrac{\\beta_h}{2}\\right) \\approx R\\beta_h$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the angle $\\beta_h$ (the azimuthal angle) to correspond to the beamwidth via $\\beta_h = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{l}$ (where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength and $l$ the antenna lenght in the direction of satellite propagation), one can further write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_a\\left(R\\right)\\approx R\\dfrac{\\lambda}{l}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel dimension orthogonal to the propagation direction of the satellite, the so-called range-width $r_{\\rho}\\left(\\tau \\right)$, is a function of the pulse duration $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{\\rho}\\left(\\tau \\right) = \\dfrac{v\\tau}{2\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\theta$ denotes the polar angle, or incidence angle. The distance $R$ can be expressed as function of $\\theta$ via trigonometric relations, as $R=H\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)$, where $H$ is the satellites altitude.\n",
